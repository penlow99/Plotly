# Plotly Dashboard
Come for the dashboarding, stay for the oddly interesting belly button science!

## Overview:
This project explores basic dashboard concepts using the Plotly library for JavaScript. The following charts were used to visualize the results from a bacterial study, using samples collected from the navels of test subjects:
- horizontal bar chart
- indicator chart (speed gauge)
